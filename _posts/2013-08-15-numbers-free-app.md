Numbers Free is a dead simple game where you select blocks that add up to a number on screen. I built the game over a few weekends to play around with canvas and [createjs](http://www.createjs.com/). If you have a few minutes to spare, you can get it here: [Numbers Free](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/games/numbers-free/9wzdncrdrdw7).
